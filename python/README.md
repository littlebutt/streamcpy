# streamcpy: The Stream Api in Python

This package contains StreamPy for Python3 version. It is only a hint for how to implement StreamPy in C and it is not 
packed in the StreamPy package. Currently, these following methods are implemented:

- [x] filter
- [x] map
- [x] for_each
- [x] collect
- [x] distinct
- [x] limit
- [x] reduce
- [ ] sorted
- [x] max/min
- [x] count
- [x] any_match/all_match

Notice: The Python version is a little different with the C version due to language features
